		// 5. Pick a char inside your String, and use a loop to determine
		//    what position/index in the String the char is located.
		//    Print the char's post the console.
//i have no idea use it to somehow determine the position but i have nothing else 
//wait what did you say again?
		//    EXAMPLE: if your string is  "abc" and you are searching 
		//             for char 'b', then print "b is at index 1"

			//the letter and the position of that letter
			// syso also I got to do it the hard way or....
		System.out.println(sun.charAt(moon)+" "+ moon);
		
		
			//wait where do i put the number that i want to use? Whe
		}
		// oof no the length it was something like it ish 
		// I mean that the sun.length was kinda like printing out
